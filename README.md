# DNS Flush

Hey there! So, I made this little program called DNS Flush using Python that basically lets you clear your DNS cache or save a log with just a few clicks. I made it because I was getting tired of having to constantly open up the command prompt on Windows and type in those commands. Hopefully this makes things a bit easier for you too!


## Features

#### Graphical User Interface
I have added a simple graphical user interface with three buttons, Exit, Clear, and Log.

- Clear Button: This function allows you to clear the DNS cache.
- Save Log: This function saves the results of the command prompt to a log file.
- Exit: Closes the application.

## Installation

To use this program, simply download the and run DNS Flush.

``` 
    DNS Flush.exe
```

> **Note** For regular users, it is only necessary to download and run the DNS Flush.exe file. The DNS Flush folder contains uncompiled files for developers to read, modify or recompile the application.
